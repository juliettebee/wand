# ðŸª„  Wand
An app to create and run spells with [Kano's Harry Potter wand](https://kano.me/us/store/products/coding-wand).

## Acknowledgments
* [kano_wand](https://github.com/GammaGames/kano_wand) - Being open source and having service IDs for the wand.

## Why should I use this as opposed to using Kano's IDE or APIs?
This project is designed to be a tool that allows you to create spells that when preformed sends a HTTP POST request to the URL specified while creating the spell. If you want an API you can use the Swift API I wrote for this project, [WandKit](https://github.com/justnaa/WandKit) or use GammaGames' [kano_wand](https://github.com/GammaGames/kano_wand) if you want a Python API. Kano also supplies a drag and drop IDE for the wand for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/harry-potter-wand-kit-by-kano/id1435177844) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kano.app). 

## Will this ever be on the App Store?
No.
